\abstract{

  This little text gives a step by step introduction into untyped lambda
  calculus. All needed theory is explained and no special know how is
  assumed. Although elementary, all important theorems about untyped lambda
  calculus including some undecidability theorems are given and proved within
  this text.

  It has been tried to use a notation which is easy to understand with a lot
  of graphic notation to support a good intuition about the presented
  material.  }
