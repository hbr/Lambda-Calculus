        <h1>Typed Lambda Calculus / Calculus of Constructions</h1>


        <p>This little text gives a step by step introduction into untyped
        lambda calculus. All needed theory is explained and no special know how
        is assumed. Although elementary, all important theorems about untyped
        lambda calculus including some undecidability theorems are given and
        proved within this text.</p>

        <p>It has been tried to use a notation which is easy to understand with
        a lot of graphic notation to support a good intuition about the
        presented material.</p>
