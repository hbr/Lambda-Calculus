        <h1>Typed Lambda Calculus / Calculus of Constructions</h1>

        <p> In this text we describe the calculus of constructions as one of the
        most interesting typed lambda calculus. It is a sweet spot in the design
        space of typed lambda calculi because it can express an immense set of
        computable functions and it can express a large set of logical
        propositions including their proofs.
        </p>

        <p> The paper is written in a textbook style.
        The needed concepts are introduced step by step and the proofs are layed
        out sufficiently detailed for newcomers to the subject.  The readers who
        are familiar with basic concepts of lambda calculus and computer science
        can get a good unterstanding of typed lambda calculus.
        </p>
