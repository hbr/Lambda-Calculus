In this text we describe the calculus of constructions as one of the most
interesting typed lambda calculus. It is a sweet spot in the design space of
typed lambda calculi because it can express an immense set of computable
functions and it can express a large set of logical propositions include their
proofs.

The paper is written in a textbook style. The readers who are familiar with
basic concepts of lambda calculus and computer science can get a good
unterstanding of typed lambda calculus. The needed concepts are introduced step
by step and the proofs are layed out sufficiently detailed for newcomers to the
subject.
